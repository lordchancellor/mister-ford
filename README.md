This repo contains the latest version of my portfolio website, rebuilt as an Angular app, using the Angular Material library. Feel free to use it as a basis for your own portfolio or project site!

### Using the code

You will need to have the Angular CLI installed globally, which you can do with ```npm install -g @angular/cli```. Once you have the project downloaded, run ```npm install``` to fetch the node modules.

### Starting the app

To see the app working on a local development server, simply run ```ng serve```.
